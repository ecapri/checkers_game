Implement checkers interface to play against various bots.

First commit focused on a very basic GUI. The main idea was to get a working interface and introduce a random bot that selects random moves.

Second commit focused on implementing a Minimax search algorithm and data collection.

A Monte Carlo Search was then introduced with a time setting.
